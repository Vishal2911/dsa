Arrays:

An array is a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
The length of an array is part of its type, which means arrays cannot be resized.
Slices:

A slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.
Slices are more versatile than arrays and are commonly used in Go.
Syntax:

Arrays:

go
Copy code
var arr [5]int // array of 5 integers
arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // array with initialization
Slices:

go
Copy code
var slice []int // slice of integers
slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // slice with initialization
2. Common Operations
Insertion:

Arrays:

Direct assignment since arrays are fixed-size.
go
Copy code
arr[0] = 10
Slices:

Use the built-in append function.
go
Copy code
slice = append(slice, 10)
Deletion:

Arrays:

Since arrays are fixed in size, deletion isn't typically performed; however, elements can be set to zero values.
go
Copy code
arr[0] = 0
Slices:

Use slicing to remove elements.
go
Copy code
// Remove element at index i
slice = append(slice[:i], slice[i+1:]...)
Traversal:

Arrays and Slices:
Use a for loop.
go
Copy code
// Array traversal
for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
    fmt.Println(arr[i])
}

// Slice traversal
for i, v := range slice {
    fmt.Println(i, v)
}
